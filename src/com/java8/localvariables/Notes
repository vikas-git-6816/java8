Q - What is local variable?
A - Any variable declared inside a method is called local variable.

Q - What are the restrictions put over local variables by lambdas?
A - * Local variable name cannot match the lambda parameter name.
    * Local variable name cannot match the name of any variable used inside the lambda.
    * We are not allowed change a local variables value inside lambda.
    * Lambdas are allowed to use local variables inside them, but are not allowed to modify them even if they are not declared final. This concept is known as Effectivelly final.
      Prior to java8 , any variable that was used inside inner class needed to be declared final. Hence lamda here also save us few key-strokes(need not to type final).
    * No Restrictions over instance variables.

Q - What is the advantage of effectively final?
A - * Easy to perform concurrency operations.
    * promotes functional programming and demotes the imperative style programming.
